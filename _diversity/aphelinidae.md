## Introduction
Aphelinidae are among the smallest and most unique chalcid wasp. Species in the family specialize on some of the most agriculturally impactful insects including whiteflies, scale insects, mealybugs and aphids. In many species the males and females undergo development in different host organisms, with the male sometimes developing on females of the same species. Most aphelinids are less than 1.5 mm in length, brown to yellow in color and incredibly soft bodied, making them a challenge to house in museums due to their tendency to shrink.
